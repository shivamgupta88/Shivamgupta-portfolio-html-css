    <p  class ="content-container" style="padding: 2 rem;padding-left: 2rem; padding-right: 2rem; margin: auto;">For me it's always heart above everything else.

        Mind paves a practical path to live a straightforward life.
        
        Heart helps you in living your dreams, making impossible possible, or at least trying wholeheartedly, it gives you intensity and passion.
        
        The rollercoaster of a life I have had is all because of being a slave to my heartâ€™s commands.
        
        And the best part is your heart doesn't see money, beauty, fame, and any materialistic object, it subtly notices your happiness, your superior purpose, your deep objectives in life. (And if you think the opposite, it's not your heart speaking, it's just the craving of pleasure)
        
        Listening to the heart may fail you in front of the entire world but you succeed in your own eyes. You feel joyful, satisfied and at peace with life.
        
        It saves you from regret.
        
        Well, that's my opinion because most people would call a person like me immature, childish or reckless, and somehow I find a positive connotation in all these words
